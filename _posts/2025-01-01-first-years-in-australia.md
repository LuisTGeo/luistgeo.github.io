Life, for me, unfolds in cycles—much like seasons. There’s winter, spring, autumn, and those intense bursts I call "sprints." These sprints are when I push myself to the limit, hungry for knowledge and experience, fighting to grow. But they can’t last too long; exhaustion creeps in, and rest becomes essential. This rhythm has marked my journey, from my roots in Peru to my new chapter in Australia.

When I arrived in Sydney, I was already running on fumes. Months earlier, in Peru, I’d poured my energy into a sprint that landed me my first full-time job as a Software Engineer. It was with a company I’m 400% grateful for—they took a chance on me, despite my experience being mostly from personal projects. That opportunity fueled me, but by the time I reached Australia, I needed a new spark. I sought out people with hunger—those who thrive, build their dreams, and move forward relentlessly. That search led me to FishBurner.

For 45 days straight, I took a bus with my big screen tucked under my arm. It wasn’t just about finding a desk; it was about creating a space where I could work better, surrounded by Australian entrepreneurs brimming with passion. I missed a day or two—memory fails me—but I was there, soaking it in. These people were polite, supportive, always giving kudos to one another. It reshaped my thinking and gave me a glimpse of what I could become.

"You are not for an internship."

Beyond FishBurner, I threw myself into MeetUps. I attended as many as I could, even when my salary from Peru barely stretched far enough. At times, I worked part-time as a waiter to make ends meet, all while holding onto my full-time remote job. I’d laugh at myself—sleeping through conference talks, showing up just to mingle—but it was worth it. I crafted a speech, a personal pitch I repeated so often it became my sword and shield. One day, a guy named Simon listened quietly as I rambled. His words—something like, "You are not for an internship"—hit me hard. He arranged an interview with his company. I didn’t end up working there, but his belief in me was a turning point. It gave me hope that I belonged at their level.

That moment ignited something. I started applying to jobs on LinkedIn like my life depended on it. Suddenly, I was flooded with interviews. For nearly a month, I barely left my room, prepping relentlessly for each one. I lived on coffee and oats—not because I couldn’t afford more, but because I refused to dip into my savings unless it was an emergency. Back then, skipping meals didn’t feel dangerous; it was just part of the grind. Now, with the training I do, not eating would be a sin.

The Power of Persistence
Looking back, I’m amazed at what I pulled off. I wasn’t eating well, I was working full-time remotely, and I was studying English to prepare for my Master’s. Yet, I still landed job offers and advanced to second-stage interviews. It taught me how much we’re capable of when we refuse to give up. Hunger—literal and figurative—drove me forward.

That season of my life wasn’t glamorous. It was messy, exhausting, and full of sacrifices. But it was mine. Each cycle, each sprint, brought me closer to where I am now. And while the noise of the world can be deafening, I’ve learned to tune it out and focus on what matters: growth, connection, and the next opportunity.

Resilience isn’t just surviving—it’s thriving through the chaos.
Opportunity often hides in the people you meet—chase those connections.
Hunger keeps you moving, but rest keeps you alive.

The longer I live, the more I see life as a series of sprints and seasons. Some days, you fight with everything you’ve got. Others, you pause to breathe. Both are vital. As I write this on March 16, 2025, I’m still running my race—hungry, hopeful, and ready for the next cycle.
